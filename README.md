# Rip Currents Detection and segmentation 
Repository containing work on rip current detection and segmentation. The work is ongoing and can be subject to continuos modifications. Check back periodically for updates.

The logs, details, dataset and other information presented in the CVPR2023 NTIRE workshop paper "Rip Current Segmentation: A Novel Benchmark and YOLOv8 Baseline Results" can be found <here>. That specific folder is frozen as to preserve information from the paper. Depending on the time of access, an updated version of that information can be found in the main repo.
